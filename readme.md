## 🎯 Project Overview

This senior project analyzes and compares four different approaches to processing large datasets, measuring their performance characteristics to help developers choose the optimal strategy for their specific use case.

## 🔍 What This Project Does

**The Problem**: When processing large amounts of data, there are multiple architectural approaches, but it's unclear which performs best under different conditions.

**The Solution**: Build and benchmark four different data processing patterns:

1. **Sequential Processing** - Process records one at a time
2. **Batch Processing** - Process data in chunks 
3. **Parallel Processing** - Use multiple workers simultaneously
4. **Stream Processing** - Process data as continuous streams

## 🏗️ Architecture Approaches

### Sequential Approach
```
Data → Process Record 1 → Process Record 2 → ... → Result
```
- **Best for**: Small datasets, simple transformations
- **Trade-off**: Slow but uses minimal memory

### Batch Approach  
```
Data → [Batch 1000] → Process → [Batch 1000] → Process → Result
```
- **Best for**: Medium datasets, database operations
- **Trade-off**: Faster than sequential, moderate memory usage

### Parallel Approach
```
Data → Split into 4 chunks → Process all chunks simultaneously → Merge → Result
```
- **Best for**: CPU-intensive tasks, multi-core systems
- **Trade-off**: Fastest processing but uses more memory

### Stream Approach
```
Data → Stream → Transform → Stream → Result (continuous flow)
```
- **Best for**: Very large files, real-time processing
- **Trade-off**: Constant memory usage, good for massive datasets

## 📊 What Gets Measured

- **⏱️ Execution Time** - How long each approach takes
- **💾 Memory Usage** - How much RAM each approach consumes  
- **🚀 Throughput** - Records processed per second
- **⚡ Efficiency** - Performance per resource used

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

**Primary Implementation**: TypeScript/Node.js
- Fast prototyping and development
- Rich ecosystem for data processing
- Easy performance monitoring

**Secondary Implementation**: Go
- High-performance comparison
- Excellent concurrency primitives  
- Memory-efficient processing

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
Node.js 18+ and npm
Go 1.19+ (for Go implementation)
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd data-processing-analyzer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the benchmark
npm start
```

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Test with different data sizes
npm start 10000    # 10K records
npm start 100000   # 100K records
npm start 1000000  # 1M records
```

## 📈 Expected Output
```
🚀 Data Processing Performance Analysis

Method          Time(ms)   Memory(MB)   Records/sec
Sequential      2,450      15.2         4,082
Batch           1,890      22.8         5,291  
Parallel        980        45.6         10,204
Stream          1,200      8.1          8,333

✨ Analysis: Parallel processing wins for speed,
   Stream processing wins for memory efficiency
